# Spam-email-detection-with-feedback-loop
Hi! This project focuses on the detection of spam emails through the development of a machine learning model. 
With the increasing issue of inbox clutter caused by unwanted emails, the goal is to efficiently classify these spam emails automatically.

The project involves a comprehensive analysis of various machine learning algorithms, with the Naive Bayes model achieving the highest accuracy among them.

Furthermore, the scope of the project extends to real-time email classification by integrating it with a personal Gmail account. 
This integration allows for user feedback, creating a feedback loop that seeks user validation for classifying emails as spam or legitimate (ham). 
The feedback collected from users is then used to continually improve the model, aiming for consistently accurate predictions.
